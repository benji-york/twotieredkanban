  <p>In this demo version of Valuenator, you can work with tasks just as you
    would in the on-line version, except that:</p>
  <ul class="simple">
    <li>All data is stored locally in your browser.</li>
    <li>Therefore, you can't share tasks with other people.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="section" id="concepts">
    <h1>Concepts</h1>
    <p>The goal of feature flow is to provide value as quickly as
      possible.  Examples of value include enabling a customer to do something
      new, or more easily, increasing efficiency, or learning something
      about a customer or market</p>
