Some notes on authentication.

Authentication will be performed in 2 steps.

Initial authentication will use oauth in production.  For dev, we'll
use a puntastic form of authentication where a use need only supply an
email query string on the / request. Note that a minimal version of
the punt is *all* we're doing now.

Initial authentication will cause a JWT token to be saved in a cookie
and will suffice for authentication when present.  A logout route
clears this.
