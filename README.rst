Feature-flow/Valuenator
=======================

`Feature-flow <http://feature-flow.readthedocs.io>`_ is an agile
practice for organizing work around units of value rather than time.

The Valuenator application, implemented here, provides a tool you can
use to implement the practice.

Status and changes
==================

The software is currently in an alpha state. You can try out a `demo
version <http://valuenator.com/demo>`_ that stores data persistently
in your browser.  It currently requires Chrome. We'll be adding
support for other browsers soon.

We'll also be announcing a beta for an on-line version soon.
