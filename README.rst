Two-tiered Kanban on Asana
==========================

This application uses an Asana *project* to model a development team.
Top level *tasks* model *releases*. *Subtasks* model release tasks.

In your Asana setupm you must define the tags: analysis, devready
(ready for development), development, demo, deploy, deployed, ready,
doing, nr (needs review), review, and done.  These represent the
various states on the board.

You can drag releases and tags around to represent progress.
